## Neural Style Transfer 
The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called a transfer learning, which is exactly what we will be doing here. Therefore, Neural Style Transfer means, transferring the style from one image onto another image and generating a new image, with the combined features of both images using a pretrained Deep CNN called VGG Network. To be even more precise, we'll be using [VGG-19](https://iq.opengenus.org/vgg19-architecture/), a 19-layer version of the VGG network.
